## [Using Window Functions To Get Top N per Group](https://www.codewars.com/kata/582001237a3a630ce8000a41)

### Description

Given the schema presented below write a query, which uses a **window function**, that returns two most viewed posts for every category.

Order the result set by:

1. category name alphabetically
2. number of post views largest to lowest
3. post id lowest to largest    

    
##### Note:

* Some categories may have less than two or no posts at all.
* Two or more posts within the category can be tied by (have the same) the number of views. Use post id as a tie breaker - a post with a lower id gets a higher rank.

### Schema

#### categories

```
 Column     | Type                        | Modifiers
------------+-----------------------------+----------
id          | integer                     | not null
category    | character varying(255)      | not null
```

#### posts

```
 Column     | Type                        | Modifiers
------------+-----------------------------+----------
id          | integer                     | not null
category_id | integer                     | not null
title       | character varying(255)      | not null
views       | integer                     | not null
```

### Desired Output

The desired output should look like this:

```
category_id | category | title                             | views | post_id
------------+----------+-----------------------------------+-------+--------
5           | art      | Most viewed post about Art        | 9234  | 234
5           | art      | Second most viewed post about Art | 9234  | 712
2           | business | NULL                              | NULL  | NULL
7           | sport    | Most viewed post about Sport      | 10    | 126
...

```

* `category_id` - category id
* `category` - category name
* `title` - post title
* `views` - the number of post views
* `post_id` - post id


## Solutions
#### 🗃️ Sql
```sql
with res as
(
  select *,
         row_number() over (partition by category_id order by views desc, id asc) as rn
  from posts p
)
select c.id as category_id, category, title, views, r.id as post_id
from categories c
left outer join res r on r.category_id=c.id and rn < 3

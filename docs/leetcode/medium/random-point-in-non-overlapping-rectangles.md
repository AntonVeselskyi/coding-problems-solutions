# Random Point in Non-overlapping Rectangles

## [Random Point in Non-overlapping Rectangles](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-point-in-non-overlapping-rectangles)

Given a list of **non-overlapping** axis-aligned rectangles `rects`, write a function `pick` which randomly and uniformily picks an **integer point** in the space covered by the rectangles.

Note:

1. An **integer point** is a point that has integer coordinates. 
2. A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is **included** in the space covered by the rectangles. 
3. `i`th rectangle = `rects[i]` = `[x1,y1,x2,y2]`, where `[x1, y1]` are the integer coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and `[x2, y2]` are the integer coordinates of the top-right corner.
4. length and width of each rectangle does not exceed `2000`.
5. `1 <= rects.length <= 100`
6. `pick` return a point as an array of integer coordinates `[p_x, p_y]`
7. `pick` is called at most `10000` times.

**Example 1:**

```text

Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[[[1,1,5,5]]],[],[],[]]
Output: 
[null,[4,1],[4,1],[3,3]]
```

**Example 2:**

```text

Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick","pick","pick"]
[[[[-2,-2,-1,-1],[1,0,3,0]]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: 
[null,[-1,-2],[2,0],[-2,-1],[3,0],[-2,-2]]
```

**Explanation of Input Syntax:**

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. `Solution`'s constructor has one argument, the array of rectangles `rects`. `pick` has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.
